<p>Suppose you have a file that contains the entire text of "War and Peace" by Leo Tolstoy. In this file, each sentence of the novel is on a new line.</p>
<p>You want to write a program that preprocesses the text (e.g. splits sentences into words, and deletes punctuation marks). What is the optimal way to read this file?</p>
<p></p><div class="alert alert-primary">Mind that you are likely to do several operations in each line to preprocess the novel.</div>
